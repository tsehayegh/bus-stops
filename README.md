People always travel to different cities whether for a business, vacation, or other issues. Most of them depend on public transportation to visit places during their stay in the city. Some may take taxis, trains, or buses. This web application is designed to help anyone looking to find the closest bus stop(s) from their current locations. The user will enter the current address and the app will show all bus stops within half a kilometer(assuming a half kilomter is a reasonal walking distance) from the current location. For this capstone project, Chapel Hill, a city in North Carolina, which has open data and API for its transit system is used. But the app can be scaled for any city.

Once the user enters the address of the current location and hit enter key or press the Search button, a list of bus stops within half of a kilomter radius will be shown on the right side of the screen. The user can scroll up and down the list and when selected any of the bus stops, a zoomed in of the bus stop location will be shown. 

For the future, other several features can be added to the app. For example, it can be developed more to show the bus schedules and list them by time that the bus arrives at the bus stop or show walking distance and time to the selected bus stop.
